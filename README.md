Description of the repository

Neural Networks for Student marks dataset

Attribute information

1: Gender :- This attribute tells us whether the student is either male or female.
2: Race   :- This attribute tells us whether the student belongs to Group A,B,C,D and E.
3: Parental level of education :- This attribute tell us till what level the parents have studied.
